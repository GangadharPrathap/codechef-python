'''
Each item in Chefâ€™s menu is assigned a spice level from 1 to 10. 
Based on the spice level, the item is categorised as:
MILD: If the spice level is less than 4.
MEDIUM: If the spice level is greater than equal to 4 but less than 7
HOT: If the spice level is greater than equal to 7.
Given that the spice level of an item is X, find the category it lies in.
